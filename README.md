# **UsersLab.Co**

## **Project Description**

> ### It's a simple and useful `Users List Application` which imprints list of users and display their relevant information. A tool that provides utilities such as showing list of users and their information, can add new users, have server side data operations: searching and sorting so that end users can refine the users list to your convinience.

### Tech Stack: React JS, React Router, Tailwind CSS and React Icons

## **Features**

- display list of users in a card layout as the page loads
- display details of an individual user
- create new users
- Search functionality with debounce technique to control the frequency of an api call
- have Data Operation like sorting so that users are able to refine the users list with ease
- Custom form Validation to make the user experience much better
- leverage a design pattern: Compound Component for reusable and flexible component and also used render props pattern
- Used Composition pattern for building better layouts
- For Styling I used Tailwind CSS to make the UI looks clean and responsive.

## **My approaches**

- Divide the application into multiple of feature categories, In this app, there's only 1 feature category: users.
- Next up I drill down users feature category, figured out all the features it need
- Take one feature at a time, break up that UI feature into components to separate responsibilities, think about state Management (which type: local/global) and data flow to power up the feature
- striving for reusable component whenever need arises
- Fully Responsive Design
